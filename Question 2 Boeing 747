Question 2:
How many ping pong balls fit in Boeing 747 airplane?

First off, the size of a ping pong ball is roughly 2in.x2in.x2in.(Length, Width, Height) all around.

Since the ping pong ball is 2in. all 'round, then 6 ping pong balls can fit in one(1) foot.

A normal Boeing 747 (at least the ones I found out) are roughly 230ft. length, roughly 25ft.
(excluding the tail and wing span) width, and roughly 30ft. (excluding tail height) height.

Once again, since 6 ping pong balls can fit within 1 foot, we can make a simple calculation:
6*230 = 1380
6*25 = 150
6*30 = 180

Now that we have all the right LxWxH of the ping pong balls we can multiply their totals:
1380*150*180 = 37,260,000 ping pong balls

The final total (37,260,000) would include the space in the cockpit, passenger seating, luggage overhang, 
storage compartment and any free space within those dimensions. If I would take the wing span, engines,
and other small areas that I excluded before, then I would say roughly 40,000,000 million ping pong 
balls would fit inside a Boeing 747.
